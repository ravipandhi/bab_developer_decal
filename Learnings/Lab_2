Tools for Dapp development:

Truffle handles boilerplate code. (Sets up the project structure)
Ganache spins us a local blockchain instance.

*Project stucture:
Contracts: contains our source code; the old contract points to the new contract(a new version)
Migrations: add scripts for staging deployment tasks;
Test:where the test cases lies;

command 'ganache-cli' generates 10 ethereum accounts
command 'truffle console' takes you to truffle console where you can compile contracts, deploy, test etc.

IMP: Overloaded functions does not work with truffle (it works in remix). It was supposed to work in v5 but still does not.  
How to execute:

'truffle migrate' command will compile and write to local net.
let instance = await Greeter.deployed()
instance.greet()
instance.change_greeting('hi')
