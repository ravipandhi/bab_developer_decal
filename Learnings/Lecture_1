Functions of Money:

1. Medium of exchange
2. Store of value
3. Unit of value

Durability, Portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, acceptability

Byzantine General's problem is a problem that two trustless actors seperated far away wont be able to agree on the state of a system. 

Just like Internet can be divided into five layers, blockchain should also be divided:

1) Consensus Layer: that handles which ledger is the consensus ledger
2) Mining Layer: that handles incentivization
3) Propogation Layer: that determines how blocks are transmitted between nodes in a network.
4) Semantic Layer: what is the meaning of the new blocks? 
5) Application Layer: code that implements desired functionality.


Bitcoin decomposition:

1.Identity
Public and private keys
Who sent to whom, so transaction have to signed by your private key, so people recognize that you have signed it by validating it with your public address. 
Each person could have 2 raised to 127 address all to themselves (considering that the population is around 7.5 billion)
2.Consensus
3.Mining
coinbase transaction is a transaction which rewards the miners and is included in every block. 
transaction does not just contain source and destination. it contains data segments which can be used to send signals as well. 
4.Propogation
5.Semantic
6.Application 
7.Transactions
UTXO model = Unspent transaction output is like a change that you receive (lets say you give 40 btc and you receive 5 back because lambo costs 35 btc)
Bitcoin language is not turing complete. 

Explaining Bitcoin is like explaining two fundamental most important underlying technologies behind it. 
Digital Signatures: this means that yes, me and only me with my private key signed the transaction of sending BTC to other participant.
Hash functions:this means that the hash of the blocks (consisting of the transactions) remain integral.
The work put behidnd finding a number whose value is less than a certain number is called mining. The work goes on increasing (mining difficulty increases over time)
