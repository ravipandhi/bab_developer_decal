Examples to differentiate:

public - all can access

external - Cannot be accessed internally, only externally

internal - only this contract and contracts deriving from it can access

private - can be accessed only from this contract

Keep your functions private or internal unless there is a need for outside
interaction.

There is also something called fallback function. It will be called if none of the identifiers match the given function identifier. 

Be really careful with delegate calls. 

Never use a contracts's balance as a guard.

msg.data or the address of the wallet should be of a certain size.

It is really important to perform all the validation in an ICO contract. 

Keep in mind the attacks that has happened until now and then perform validation. 

It is difficult to generate a random number. If you are using block properties, they could be predicted and manipulated by miners.

throw() can be used as an alternative to revert()

Lock pragma versions to specific compiler version rather than greater than a version.
