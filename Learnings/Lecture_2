Smart contracts generally server four main purposes:
1) Store and maintain data - storing balance or membership status
2) Manage contract or relatioonship between untrusting users (escrow, defi etc)
3) Provide functions to other contracts - serving as a software library ( I like a clean, cheap code for manipulating string! this could be used by others)
4) Complex authentications (release the balance from this contract only when two out of three users sign)

OpenZeppelin provides a library (point 3) that could be imported and worked with.
