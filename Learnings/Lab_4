Midterm ICO

ERC20 is just a standard(an interface) or a set of rules that a token issuer can follow. 

So people to issue their own tokens with ethereum, write contracts. 
Now those contracts are not uniform. You might miss some method to put money into the contract but a method to take 
out of the contract. 

ERC20 is a standard set of methods and variables that help you in developing and deploying your own token contract.


Exchanges should know what methods to call to transfer tokens and what methods to get tokens out. It has to be 
a standard set of methods. 

That is where ERC 20 lies.
