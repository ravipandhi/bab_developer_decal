Ethereum:

EVM is a VM that runs on all the nodes. Transaction should have the same output on every node. Every node should be in the same state after the transaction. 
Every operation like STOP, ADD, SUB, DIV etc would incure different gas costs. 

Solidity:
Events in solidity broadcasts that certain things happen. For example, after a certain function is executed successfully, you log an event.   
Other nodes listen to the events that happened. 
msg is a globally accessible variable.
msg.sender denotes the contract caller.
function (){

    throw;
}
this is a callback function (throw reverts everything that happened)

Difference between a transaction and a call:

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/765/what-is-the-difference-between-a-transaction-and-a-call

Transaction is broadcasted to the network and requires gas
Call is internal and does not require gas because it does not change the state of the contract.
